# JT_Excel

This package allows webMethods Integration Server to create, read, update,
and write Excel spreadsheets.

## Functionality

Built on top of [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) the `JT_Excel`
package allows you to work with workbooks and sheets in `.xls` and
`.xlsx` format. You can open or create workbooks and sheets. And within
those sheets it is possible to read, update, insert, and delete data.

Typical use-cases are to create spreadsheets with data coming from
backend systems like ERP or CRM. Another popular scenario is to
employ a spreadsheet for bulk-entry of data. Together with validations
that makes for a very efficient interface for power users.
Or you could use the spreadsheets to exchange data with customers.
Individual pricelists come to mind here.

## Limitations

In terms of data formats no formats other than the spreadsheet files
in `.xls` format (no CSV etc.) and the normal data
structures of Integration Server (`IData`) are in the game.

Due to a limitation of the underlying XML library it is **not possible
to handle `.xlsx` spreadsheets**. The root cause is the logic that was
chosen to perform some automated class-loading. If you search the
Internet you will find that a lot of people complain about this.
It is not an issue specific to Integration Server, but comes up in
the context of other application servers as well.

So if you want to convert an Excel spreadsheet to JSON or XML, you will
need to write a Flow service that parses the data from the spreadsheet,
taking into account in which column and row values are located.

Once that is done, you will typically have a document list with one
document per spreadsheet row. The spreadsheet columns will be mapped to
the fields within that document.
From there you then work just as if the data had come from a database
operation, an EDI document, or any other data source or service.

As to what formats and content details are supported on the Excel side,
this is determined entirely by what Apache POI covers.

## Installation

You can install `JT_Excel` in two ways.

- There will be [releases](https://github.com/JahnTech/webmethods-is-jt_excel/releases)
  that come as a `ZIP` file and must be
  installed in the traditional way. That means copying it into
  `$IS_HOME/replicate/inbound` and then invoking
  `Package Management / Install Inbound Release`.
- For people who want to be on the bleeding edge, you can always
  just clone or download the Git repository into your workspace
  and then work with it like a developer. For any environment
  other than DEVELOPMENT this is not recommended, though.

## Samples

There is also a test package (`JT_ExcelTest`) that additionally
serves as a sample package. Please browse its services to see how
things are done.

## Built-in services

The service that come with `JT_Excel` can roughly be grouped like this:

- `jt.excel.pub.workbook` : Workbook-related operations (read, write, create)
- `jt.excel.pub.sheet` : Sheet-related operations (get, update, insert data etc.)
- `jt.excel.pub.cell` : Single cell-related operations

For the time being there is no detailed documentation for the individual
services. For inquiries about those please
get in touch with [JahnTech](https://jahntech.com).
